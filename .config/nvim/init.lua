What is Kickstart?

  Kickstart.nvim is *not* a distribution.

  Kickstart.nvim is a starting point for your own configuration.
    The goal is that you can read every line of code, top-to-bottom, understand
    what your configuration is doing, and modify it to suit your needs.

    Once you've done that, you can start exploring, configuring and tinkering to
    make Neovim your own! That might mean leaving Kickstart just the way it is for a while
    or immediately breaking it into modular pieces. It's up to you!

    If you don't know anything about Lua, I recommend taking some time to read through
    a guide. One possible example which will only take 10-15 minutes:
      - https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/

    After understanding a bit more about Lua, you can use `:help lua-guide` as a
    reference for how Neovim integrates Lua.
    - :help lua-guide
    - (or HTML version): https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html

Kickstart Guide:

    MOST IMPORTANTLY, we provide a keymap "<space>sh" to [s]earch the [h]elp documentation,
    which is very useful when you're not exactly sure of what you're looking for.


If you experience any errors while trying to install kickstart, run `:checkhealth` for more info.

I hope you enjoy your Neovim journey,
- TJ

P.S. You can delete this when you're done too. It's your config now! :)

-- [[ Configure and install plugins ]]
--
--  To check the current status of your plugins, run
--    :Lazy
--
--  You can press `?` in this menu for help. Use `:q` to close the window
--
--  To update plugins you can run
--    :Lazy update
--
-- NOTE: Here is where you install your plugins.
require('lazy').setup({
  spec = {
    -- import your plugins
    { import = "plugins" },
  },
  -- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).

	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
	-- with the first argument being the link and the following
	-- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
	--
	-- Use `opts = {}` to automatically pass options to a plugin's `setup()` function, forcing the plugin to be loaded.
	--

  -- Alternatively, use `config = function() ... end` for full control over the configuration.
  -- If you prefer to call `setup` explicitly, use:
  --    {
  --        'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim',
  --        config = function()
  --            require('gitsigns').setup({
  --                -- Your gitsigns configuration here
  --            })
  --        end,
  --    }
  --
	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
	--
	-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
	-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
	--
	-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
	--  event = 'VimEnter'
	--
	-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
	-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
	--
	-- Then, because we use the `opts` key (recommended), the configuration runs
	-- after the plugin has been loaded as `require(MODULE).setup(opts)`.

  -- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
  --
  -- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
  -- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
  --
  -- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin

	-- The following comments only work if you have downloaded the kickstart repo, not just copy pasted the
	-- init.lua. If you want these files, they are in the repository, so you can just download them and
	-- place them in the correct locations.

	-- NOTE: Next step on your Neovim journey: Add/Configure additional plugins for Kickstart
	--
	--  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the Kickstart repository.
	--  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
	--
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.debug',
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.indent_line',
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.lint',
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.autopairs',
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.neo-tree',
	-- require 'kickstart.plugins.gitsigns', -- adds gitsigns recommend keymaps

  -- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
  --    This is the easiest way to modularize your config.
  --
  --  Uncomment the following line and add your plugins to `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua` to get going.
  -- { import = 'custom.plugins' },
  --
  -- For additional information with loading, sourcing and examples see `:help lazy.nvim-üîå-plugin-spec`
  -- Or use telescope!
  -- In normal mode type `<space>sh` then write `lazy.nvim-plugin`
  -- you can continue same window with `<space>sr` which resumes last telescope search
--}, {
  ui = {
    -- If you are using a Nerd Font: set icons to an empty table which will use the
    -- default lazy.nvim defined Nerd Font icons, otherwise define a unicode icons table
    icons = vim.g.have_nerd_font and {} or {
      cmd = '‚åò',
      config = 'üõ†',
      event = 'üìÖ',
      ft = 'üìÇ',
      init = '‚öô',
